# Healthcare-Regression-Problem-Predicting-Glucose-Levels
The dataset used for this project relates to diabetes and includes features such as Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age. The target variable we aim to predict is Glucose, a key metric in diagnosing diabetes.
This project aimed to predict the glucose level in patients using a variety of health-related features such as age, body mass index, and insulin levels. This type of predictive model could be useful in healthcare for screening or managing diabetes, allowing for early interventions.
One of the challenges I faced was the presence of biologically implausible values (e.g., zero values for blood pressure or insulin). Replacing these values with the median was one way to address the issue, but a more robust solution could involve gathering additional domain-specific knowledge to impute missing values more accurately.
While executing the code I faced some bugs but after correcting the code I get the proper result, and it give correct answer, and I get bugs in zero values in specific columns in the median.
Conclusion: This project showcased the steps required to build a regression model to predict glucose levels in patients based on health-related data. Linear Regression served as a starting point, and the use of MSE allowed for a quantitative evaluation of model performance. Further enhancements could be made through advanced modeling techniques and more robust data preprocessing.
